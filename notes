Models that  I want to have in my project:

-Users Model
-Order Model
-Menu Items Model




Clients will come to the website and create an account:
  - Once they create an account they will be able to place an Order
  -A client can have many orders
  *has_many: orders

  -- name:
  --password:



Order requested will be made by the client:
  - CLients will have the option to place more than one order.
   -Order belongs a client  
   *belongs_to: client
   *has_many Menu Items




Menu Items
*belongs_to order
entree: -string
drinks: - string
desserts: - string
quantity: integer
price: - float
OR 
name: - string
description: -string
price: - float





   The Flow:
   - A person will come to the website and see the Menu
   -They will then Fill out a form to select what they want from the Menu
   - Once they have selected what they want from the menu, then they can place the order.
